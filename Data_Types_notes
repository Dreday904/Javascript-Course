Every value is either an object ex. | OR a primitive value ex.
                                    |
let me = {                          |      let firstName = 'Jonas'
   name: 'Jonas'                    |      let age = 30;
   };
   
 A value is only a primitive when it's not an object. There are 7 primitive data types.
 
 - Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, Symbol, Big Int.
 
 1. Number: Floating point numbers used for decimals and integers. let age = 23;
 
 2. Strings: Sequence of characters used for text. let firstName = 'Jonas';
 
 3. Boolean: Logical tyoe that can only be true or false used for taking decisions. let fullAge = true;
 
 4. Undefined: Value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value'). let children; 
 
 5. Null: Also means 'empty value'. 
 
 6. Symbol (ES2015): Value that is unique and cannot be changed [not useful for now]
 
 7. BigInt (ES2015): Larger integers than the number type can old. 
 
 Javascrptit has dynamic typing: which means we do not have to manually define the data type of the value 
 stored in a variable. INstead, data types are determined automatically.
